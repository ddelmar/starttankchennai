<h1>The Program</h1>
<p>
The Indian software ecosystem has been producing some excellent services for global corporations. However, the number of entrepreneurial ventures that have come up with world renowned products is very small. In the spirit of nourishing this ecosystem, and bringing out world-class software products built from India, PayPal partnered with TiE-Chennai and launched the Startup Incubator in October 2013. It provides a cost and obligation-free environment for the selected startups to evolve.

As an eBay Inc. company, PayPal constantly seeks to create new opportunities around the world by focusing on building an ecosystem that nurtures entrepreneurship and innovation.
The tenure of the program is 12 months.
